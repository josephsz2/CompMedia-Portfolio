        <p >Willow is my one of the first two projects I have worked on. It is a VGDev club project led by Yoon Lee and Mitchell Phillip. It is a 2D bullet-hell rougelike,
            featuring a weapon crafting system and a gameplay loop that focusing around recruiting NPCs to a growing festival. My role for this project was
            minor design work, including weapons, rooms, enemies, NPCs, and items. I would like to talk more about my role in this project, but it only started
            development so I have nothing specific to share. Actual screenshots and images from the game will be added when they are avaliable.

        <p>Starfall is the other of my first two projects. It is also a VGDev club project, led by Ben Lock. It is a 3D rougelike built around fast movement and
            extreme aggression. I was a designer on this project as well, focusing on creating and tweaking core combat and mechanical systems in the game, such as 
            the "Link" system that most of the combat is based around. I also designed some of the abilities, enemies, and items. This project has only started as well,
            so I will add more information when avaliable.
